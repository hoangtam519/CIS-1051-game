# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Flappy Bird


## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A game where player has to maneuver thru obstacles

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
I will be using python or java for this project. It will have a best score, menu, and a map.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will have for loops, if statements and the background feature with the hurricane lap. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I have no teammates.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I think that I'll be able to implement most of the code, I have doubts about implementing the button that the user would click to restart the game, as well as, different pipe configurations.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline? 

I think that I would need to be able to complete the first round of the game. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think the best outcome will be to have a game that the player is challenged more with a cheating aspect. if player gets to stage 4, the next attempt would make it harder for player to get to stage 4

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first step is to set up the structure of the game. If I were to choose python, I would have to download pygame. This would include basic game mechanics and user interface. I would also have to learn how to make the game as smooth and seamless as possible. I would have to make a basic game first and add more features as I see fit and doable within the timeframe.
